Deep in the planet’s depths resides an ancient, once-bustling dwarven kingdom.

At its highest peak rests a brilliant glass statue that houses the spirit of the last dwarven queen. Her ghost protects The Chandelier, a dazzling monument of crystal that serves as the final resting place for the souls of her long-forgotten kingdom.

 – and is a source of tremendous power.

Her spirit has long stood guard for The Chandelier ever since her husband sacrificed himself to push back and cast down The Strife, a dark and terrible force that their kingdom stumbled upon while digging too deeply into the planet.

Eons have passed, and The Strife have regained their strength, crawling and clawing their way back up to the doorstep of the kingdom. They have but one goal: to avenge their defeat and consume the last of the dwarven kingdom’s light.

The queen must defend her kingdom by utilizing the light of The Chandelier like a power grid. Though it is brilliant and powerful, it is finite, and must be carefully distributed amongst the mausoleum’s ancient defense systems.

These sentinel towers of tarnished mithril must reveal, incapacitate, and dispatch The Strife before their darkness swallows up the kingdom for good."
