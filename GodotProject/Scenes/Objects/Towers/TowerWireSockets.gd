Wire Sockets should be able to:
	Connect nearby towers
	Draw power from Out slot to In Slot
	Power will provide turret with abilities
	
	Player should be able to manipulate wires.
		- change source, destination
	
	~~~~~~~~~~ MVP Cutoff ~~~~~~~~~~~	
	
	Future versions might have wire upgrades, splitters, filters, etc.
